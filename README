This is all you need to create GuideXML documents
from Sphinx documentation. 

It was created for the Autodep project (GSoC 2011).
Maybe it needs to handle more stuff, but it does
everything I need right now.


To use it. Three simple steps:
1) Copy builders/guidexml.py to Sphinx's builders pkg.
2) Copy writers/guidexml.py to Sphinx's writers pkg.
3) Edit sphinx/builders/__init__.py and the following:

BUILTIN_BUILDERS = {
    ...
    'guidexml':   ('guidexml', 'GuideXML'),
    ...
}

That's it. Enjoy!
